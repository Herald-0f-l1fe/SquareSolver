# Description
This function solves a quadratic equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0 if you enter the coefficients.
# How to use
## To compile the file you need to::
To compile a file, you need to write in the command line `make`. 
## To run the file you need to:
To run the file you need to write `.\Square_Solver.exe` in the console

If you want to test the program on built-in tests, then enter `.\Square_Solver.exe -test`

If you want to test the program on your tests, then enter `.\Square_Solver.exe -test file_name.txt` where 'file_name.txt' should contain the sequentially entered values:
1. Coefficient a
2. Coefficient b 
3. Coefficient c
4. Number of roots of the equation
5. Reference first root
6. Reference second root

If you want to run the program, either do not enter anything except `.\Square_Solver.exe` or enter `.\Square_Solver.exe -start`.

# What does the program return?

The program returns the number of tests passed, if the program was tested, the number of roots and their value.

# The most important thing
This program works on Windows
I would like to express my gratitude to Aidan Munro for his mentorship.
